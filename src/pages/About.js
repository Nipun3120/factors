            <span>Over the past few decades, we have seen how the world works in the clothing industry; one goes and tries on clothes and then buys the clothes. Since the pandemic, there has been an increase in demand to try clothes at customers' leisure. However, there has not been much advancement in this field. Now, most industries are shifting to visual mode, and competitors try to advance to one; other textile industries have become popular during these difficult times with their quick shift to online mode.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <span>With our project, we aim customers to use this feature to try clothes at the customer's convenience. In the pandemic, most of us have had the displeasure with not seeing how the clothes would look on us before buying, and often finding the clothes don't look good when delivered. This leads to nuisance to return and exchange of items, causing inconvenience to both companies and the customers. The pandemic has also not made the process of exchanging or returning too easy. The concern of safety and transmission also comes to light during these difficult times.</span>
            <br/><br/>
            <span>Our project helps us to eliminate the shortcomings in the already established world of online shopping where the customers get the luxury to see how the clothes sit on their bodies, in the comfort of their homes. The major online shopping companies like Myntra, Amazon lack consideration from the customer's side, where they could not analyze how the garment would look on their bodies. They have been able to provide suggestions based on learning the styles of the customers, but haven't been able to take into consideration their body types, and show them how it looks on them. In a world like this, where your dressing style can make or break a conversation, people cannot afford to look unflattering or underconfident. Garments play a significant role in how a person feels in their body.</span>
